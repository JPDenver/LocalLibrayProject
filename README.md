# LocalLibrayProject

Hypothetical Problem Solved: A local library so far has a basic layout for an interface for their inventory program but nothing happens yet when you try to use it. They have a JSON database of information about the books the books, account holders, and data such as who has the book checked out. It was my job to implement all of the JavaScript funtionality to make the interface work. It now allows you to see if any book in the database is currently checked out and by who. You can also look up an account holder and see what books they have checked out. It keeps track of the most popular books and authors based on the number of times each book has been checked out.
